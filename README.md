1. Setting Up SecureConnect Authentication:
We kicked off the project by prioritizing user security. To register on SecureConnect, users simply input their details on the homepage. Logging in is equally straightforward with secure credential verification.
2. Boosting Security with JWT and Cookies:
We fortified user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) stored in HTTP-only cookies. This method ensures a unique JWT is generated and securely stored, enhancing security. Logging out invalidates the token, and a new one is generated upon relogin, maintaining top-notch security.
3. Efficient Development with Postman:
Our development workflow was streamlined using Postman for API testing. We created and tested requests for login, registration, user updates, and profile retrieval. This facilitated robust development, ensuring our features worked seamlessly.
4. Sleek Frontend with Vite and Bootstrap:
For a polished user interface, we opted for Vite over traditional React and integrated the Bootstrap framework. This combination not only ensures speed and efficiency but also results in a visually appealing and responsive SecureConnect.

## Challenges faced

We encountered various challenges during the build of SecureConnect. One of them is **deployment**. We will definitely try our best to deploy SecureConnect and make it available for you as early as possible.
